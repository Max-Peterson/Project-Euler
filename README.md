# Project-Euler
My simple solutions to problems found at https://projecteuler.net

# Why did I make this repository? 

While learning to code in python I used these problems as a way to practice run time analysis, as well as an entertaining 
way of implementing and improving algorithms. I will be continuing to work on and update this repository. Some of the problems have multiple solutions, each an improvement on the previous one, to demonstrate how my coding skills have evolved over time. New updates typically only include the best solution I can think of since the brute force solution is typically pretty obvious and I no longer benefit from covering it. 

Whether clever reductions of search space or using fundamental math concepts, being able to improve these solutions are what make the difference between a 
novice and intermediate programmer. Looking at the problems in order, it is clear to see how my coding skills have, and hopefully will continue to, evolve.


# Who can use this? 
 
While everyone has been given permission to use this repository via the MIT license, I think it's obvious that only absolute beginners
should examine these files once they have attempted, and possibly exhausted their patience with, the Euler Problems these files correspond 
to.
