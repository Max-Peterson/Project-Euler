# Project-Euler
My simple solutions to problems found at https://projecteuler.net

Why did I make this repository? 

While learning to code in python I used these problems as a conduit for my skills in run time analysis, as well as an entertaining 
way of practicing implementing and improving algorithms. This project contains around 40 completed problems as well as 9 incomplete 
problems. I will continue to work on and update this repository. Some of the problems, typically ones I found to be more difficult, have 
multiple solutions written in the file to show the different levels of efficiency and can exemplify how that efficiency can be improved.
Whether clever reductions of search space or using fundamental math concepts, these improvements are what make the difference between a 
novice and intermediate programmer. It might be interesting to look at all the problems in order to see exactly how my programming skills 
evolved over the few months I was working on this. 

Who can use this? 
 
While everyone has been given permission to use this repository via the MIT license, I think it's obvious that only absolute beginners
should examine these files once they have attempted, and possibly exhausted their patience with, the Euler Problems these files correspond 
to.
