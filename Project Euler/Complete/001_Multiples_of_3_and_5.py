#Multiples of 3 and 5
#If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
#Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

#intuition would have me believe that simply iterating through multiples and summing them would be an easy brute force method that would 
#prove effective up to the problem statement limit of 1000. However, this method would likely scale poorly to extremely large inputs. Perhaps 
#there are shortcuts in the math to be found...

#alternatively one can use a single iteration through the digits by using an OR and iterating through each digit. This mehtod, although also

#Finally the use of the formula âˆ‘k=1/2n(n+1). will allow for a few simple math calculations rather than an iterative process and thus 
#not scaling at runtime according to n other than byte size whereas this  previous strategy certainly has nth order scaling. However, it must be 
#remembered that multiples of 15 are counted twice as they are multiples of both 3 and 5 and that is accounted for in the third term of the following
