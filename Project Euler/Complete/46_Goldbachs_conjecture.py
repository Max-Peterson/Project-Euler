#It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

#25 = 7 + 2×3^2

#What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?

#Sieve of Marouane states that all odd composites can be made from p**2 +2*p*c where p is a prime number other than 2 and c is a constant 
#the key to this problem is solving for a the min of the function that does not allow the above equation to be equal to another p added to a square
