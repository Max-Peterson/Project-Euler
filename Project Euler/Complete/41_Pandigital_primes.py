#We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the 
#digits 1 to n exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is 
#also prime.

#What is the largest n-digit pandigital prime that exists?

#FROM CODE BLOG (https://www.mathblog.dk/project-euler-41-pandigital-prime/)
#  "The trick I learned in 4th grade was that a number is divisible by 3 if and only if the digit sum of the number is divisible by 3. 
#   The digit sum is as the name implies the sum of the digits. We can rather easily find the digit sum of pandigital numbers since we know the digits"

#I found this trick to be inredibly useful as without any testing you know that the pandigital prime must be 7 digits due to the sums of the individual digits
