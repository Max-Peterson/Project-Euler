#The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms are prime, and, (ii)
#each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another.

#There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit increasing sequence.

#What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?
