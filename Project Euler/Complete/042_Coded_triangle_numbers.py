#The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1); so 
#the first ten triangle numbers are:

#1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

#By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its 
#alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For 
#example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value 
#is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

#Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file 
#containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle 
#words?

#it would be possible to speed this code up if only slightly by calculating the inverse of the triangle number function and performing it on the sums of words
#if the result is a whole number the number is a triangle number rather than comparing to an array of triangle numbers that cover the range of sum values in the 
#text file. After switching the function to do so, the time save was ~2ms but it may be more substantial for a larger set of words.
